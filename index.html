                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) website provides information-rich resources to help all labor force participants and associated advocates. Popular, vital information visitors may need prompt access to is significantly challenging as the site is content-dense, and inconsistent navigation can complicate instead of alleviate the experience.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="solution">
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>Leverage DOL's existing content to create a responsive web redesign that enables simple and functional content discovery.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="about">
                <h4>The Department of Labor</h4>
                <p>The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) mission is to promote and improve the welfare, working conditions, and opportunities for workers, job seekers, and retirees.</p>

            </div>

        <section class="research">
            <div class="research-content">
                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>Examining primary motivations and challenges in the site visit</p>
                <p>I began research by browsing DOL's site to understand its offerings and what visitors can accomplish. Visitors to DOL's site can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Access credible, current info about common federal labor law questions</li>
                    <li>Learn about federal labor enforcement and compliance regulations</li>
                    <li>Locate guides and interactive aides to understand laws better</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Next, I conducted a heuristic evaluation to identify usability improvement areas. From the homepage, it's difficult to assess what visitors most often seek on DOL's site and how they go about discovering that information. This provided an early indicator of potential challenges visitors may feel when using the site and could benefit from a web redesign.</p>
                <p>To best serve visitors and DOL, I decided to focus the redesign on the homepage; it's the official welcoming page and serves as a central hub before venturing through DOL's extensive content.</p>
