                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) website provides information-rich resources to help all labor force participants and associated advocates. Popular, vital information visitors may need prompt access to is significantly challenging as the site is content-dense, and inconsistent navigation can complicate instead of alleviate the experience.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="solution">
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>Leverage DOL's existing content to create a responsive web redesign that enables simple and functional content discovery.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="about">
                <h4>The Department of Labor</h4>
                <p>The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) mission is to promote and improve the welfare, working conditions, and opportunities for workers, job seekers, and retirees.</p>

    <!--Design process overview section-->
        <section class="designprocess-overview">
            <div class="designprocess">
                <h2 class="text-center">Research • Analyze • Architect • Prototype • Test</h2>
            </div>
        </section>
    <!--Research section-->
        <section class="research">
            <div class="research content">
                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>Examining primary motivations and challenges in the site visit</p>
                <p>I began research by browsing DOL's site to understand its offerings and what visitors can accomplish. Visitors to DOL's site can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Access credible, current info about common federal labor law questions</li>
                    <li>Learn about federal labor enforcement and compliance regulations</li>
                    <li>Locate guides and interactive aides to understand laws better</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Next, I conducted a heuristic evaluation to identify usability improvement areas. From the homepage, it's difficult to assess what visitors most often seek on DOL's site and how they go about discovering that information. This provided an early indicator of potential challenges visitors may feel when using the site and could benefit from a web redesign.</p>
                <p>To best serve visitors and DOL, I decided to focus the redesign on the homepage; it's the official welcoming page and serves as a central hub before venturing through DOL's extensive content.</p> 
            </div>
        </section>
    <!--Analyze section-->
        <section class="analyze">
            <div class="analyze content">
                <h2>Analyze</h2>
                <p>Improving scanability to increase task success</p>
                <p>I analyzed testing results and observations through affinity mapping. I uncovered patterns in DOL's UI navigation, content elements, and frustrations observed during testing. Analysis revealed that visitors find dense content and difficult navigation as the most significant problems on DOL's site.</p>
                <p>It was important to balance satisfying visitors' and DOL's needs while elevating the site experience. I culminated my testing observations and heuristic evaluation to determine which services and features are essential to DOL and its visitors.</p>
                <p>Goal: improve usability for high scanability and fluid navigation</p>
                <p>Strategy: prioritize visitor needs, then focus on features critical to DOL while remaining user-centric.</p>
            </div>
        </section>
    <!--Architect section-->
        <section class="architect">
            <div class="architect content">
                <h2>Architect</h2>
                <p>Combining existing research and primary evidence to strengthen content structure and accessibility.</p>
                <p>I conducted an open card sort to simplify DOL's primary and secondary navigation. I created clear, concise labels based on a culmination of research of existing DOL-provided resources, including FAQs, and existing content groupings.</p>
                <p>DOL's existing site structure is complex. Many topic labels are jargon-dense. Similar topics lack grouping, which detracts from scanability and an intuitive design. Many topics are often duplicates and create ambiguity when interpreted among users.</p>
                <p>My strategy was to group similar topics based on high-level categorical relationships. I also investigated existing pages with ambiguous navigation titles to determine the best placement in the updated site map and overall site structure.</p>
            </div>
        </section>
    <!--Prototype section-->
        <section class="prototype">
            <div class="prototype content">
                <h2>Prototype</h2>
                <p>Mobile-first design to prioritize content and best serve all users across device platforms</p>
                <p>DOL offers pertinent info and resources that impact the livelihood of most site visitors. Given the magnitude of work in one's life, I designed DOL's site from a mobile-first perspective where visitors can access information conveniently and with greater flexibility, given the prominence of mobile devices as consumers' primary browsers.</p>
            </div>
        </section>
    <!--Test section-->
        <section class="test">
            <div class="test content">
                <h2>Test</h2>
                <p>Iterating for continual improvement</p>
                <p>I evaluated the functionality and intuitiveness of my redesign through multi-round testing and iterated based on feedback.</p>
                <p>Specifically, I conducted 5-second and navigational usability testing to assess first impressions of the new homepage and navigation fluidity. I incorporated the feedback from both tests into subsequent iterations:</p>
            </div>
        </section>
    <!--Branding section-->
    <!--Final design section-->
    <section class="final-design">
        <div class="final-design content">
            <h2>Welcome to the Department of Labor</h2>
            <h3>Popular topic categories</h3>
            <p>DOL's existing quick links have low prominence in their placement below the fold. The navigation items are also redundant, considering other topic links. During testing, I even noticed that only 25% of users navigated to a new page through a quick links path.</p>
            <p>I used these links in conjunction with another existing resource of DOL, a top 20 list of the most requested topics, to repurpose quick links as 5 popular topic categories.</p>
            <p>The topics allow visitors to see at-a-glance which subject may best fit their needs efficiently and invitingly.</p>
            <h3>Efficient navigation</h3>
            <p>Updated keyword-matching labels for improved scanability in discovering information</p>
            <p>Rearranged categories to further incorporate LATCH (hierarchy) principles. Categories are listed in order of importance, top to bottom (and left to right).</p>
            <p>A few of DOL's frequently requested topics are managed by interoffices with their external sites for further information. I created a special area on the homepage to inform visitors of the sites, the office's primary function, and links to the sites to access more relevant information. This minor addition also helps sustain DOL's brand authenticity by assuring visitors that their browsing experience will still be safe as the sites are also actively managed by DOL.</p>
